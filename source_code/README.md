#### 1. Use any package-level supply chain construction tool(e.g. Google open source insights) to construct the package-level supply chain first. This step helps obtain the dependents of the target packages.

#### 2. Use the code in 'fine-grained_supply_chain_analysis' to obtaining source code of projects and construct the method-level supply chain.

#### 3. Use the code in 'propagation_analysis' to conduct the method-level vulnerability propagation analysis.
